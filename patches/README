README for the third-party patches to ShadowIRCd
================================================

This is the third-party patches section of ShadowIRCd.
These patches were all discluded from going mainline for one reason or
another. It is important to not that they are *NOT* officially supported
and your ShadowIRCd will not get any support if you've applied any of them.

You should mv them one directory up and apply them like:

            patch -p1 < patch-name.patch


Current Patch List:
===================

readd_cmode_D.patch:
Re-adds channelmode +D (no ACTIONs) which was removed (for being stupid and
pointless) in ShadowIRCd 7.0. It is not readded to disabledmodes because if
you're applying the patch, you obviously want the feature.


readd_cmode_E.patch:
Re-adds channelmode +E (no KICKs) which was removed (for being stupid and
pointless) in ShadowIRCd 7.0. It is not readded to disabledmodes because if
you're applying the patch, you obviously want the feature.
